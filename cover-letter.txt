For the last 9 years I have worked for Bloomtools, building, from the ground up, one of the
most fully featured and usable set of website and marketing tools in Australia. As Technical Lead,
I have worked on every aspect of the software, from designing the MySQL database for the website's
shop software, to tweaking CSS animations for the search forms on AJAX powered data-tables.

First and foremost, my role is that of Senior PHP Developer, however my experience also extends to
frontend development, system administration, and devops. I really enjoy both PHP and Javascript
development and have spent most of my time working in these languages. I'm also not afraid to put
PHP and Javascript to the side and use the right tool for the job. For example, I've recently spent
time as a python programmer, writing a small consumer script to connect to a Beanstalkd message
queue to set up a website's email account on a mail server.

Being the senior developer has given me the freedom to introduce new technologies and processes
to the company. In the last few years I have pushed Bloomtools to develop in a more agile way;
migrating from SVN to git, and breaking development cycles into sprints has meant that code
written yesterday can be used by customers tomorrow. I constantly enjoy learning new skills and
sharing this knowledge with my team members.

Kind Regards,

Ben Sorohan
